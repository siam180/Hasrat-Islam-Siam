Final_NY_BnB using the New York dataset from Airbnb website for my course project, tried to find the best place to invest in a new property.
Investor need to know which area has a higher demand and more listings so inversor's new investment has high ROI.
A new column duration was created in R studio, from a column minimum_nights stay, the average minimum nights stay for properties were 7. So longstay is properties where minimum nights was over 7 nights and short stay is properties with minimum night stay was below or equal to 7 nights.
Data had many missing values and outliers which need to be taken care of.
Some visualizations were used to showcase the current situation of New York in terms of Airbnb
Project still under work
Next steps to look more in Neighbourhood areas with higher listing and narrow down to smaller neighbourhoods.
Finally try to build a Regresion Forest Model or Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict price given other features
This will be a Estimation Model as oppose to Classification Model, as predictive value price is NUMERIC.
